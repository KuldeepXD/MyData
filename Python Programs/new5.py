'''Loops'''
#FOR LOOP
# for i in range(0,10):
# # print(x) here printed as 0 next line 1
# # If I want space and in single line output e.g. 0 1 2 3
# #     print(i,end=" ")

# "Table Program"
# a=int(input("Enter the number: "))

# for i in range(1,11):
#    print(a*i,end=" ")
'Table by a different method'
# a=int(input("Enter the number: "))
# b=(a*10)+1 
# #this logic is for selecting end range as we know loop runs to 10-1 value so added 1 to range
# for i in range (a,b,a):
    # print(i)
'Using for loop in equation'
# a=[1,2,6,7,5,4]# List
# x(cube)+2x+c equation
# for x in a:
#     ab=(x**3)+(2*x)+3
#     print(ab)

'''Whlie Loop'''
# print(3<2)
a=0
while a<=15:
    print(a)
    a+=1
    #if print (a) is printed below a+=1 then o/p will show 31 as well because loop runs for =30
